IXD301: Designing User Experiences
==================================

The [Designing User Experiences](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/01/designing-user-experiences.html) module covers a lot of ground, but – good news – it maps over to the other Year 2, Semester 1 module [Narrative and Storytelling](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/02/narrative-and-storytelling.html). If you work cleverly and creatively the two modules can inform each other and, in fact, they should.

Both of these modules explore the growing field of User Experience (UX). They encourage the creation of delightful user experiences, stressing the need to map out considered user journeys that are fit for purpose, meeting users’ needs. (Note: Meeting users’ needs is critical, as we’ll explore early on in the semester, when we consider user research and user personas.)

The module will focus on two deliverables:

1. Developing an app for Little Wing Pizza. (A live project, with a client briefing leading to the possible realisation of your idea.)
2. A simple weather-related web app that teaches you about JavaScript and JSON.

###Week 01 - Introduction; Brief 1, Meet the Client; Idea Generation

24 September, 2015

This week, we’ll kick off with an introduction to the module. We’ll outline the structure of the semester, which is reflected – and updated regularly – in this GitHub repo. We’ll also give out the module descriptors and assessment criteria. (These are pinned to the wall in the IxD studio.)

We’ll meet the client, Little Wing Pizza, for a briefing on the project: a game of some description targeted at kids and their parents, as the client put it, “The parents are just older kids.”

Once the client leaves, we’ll hit the ground running with an idea generation workshop, where we’ll come up with some concepts. This, broadly, maps onto what we taught you in Year 1 and should act as a refresher. Remember: It pays to start with paper and our design process on the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design reflects that.

Finally, we’ll look at the importance of developing User Personas and conducting user research. As outlined in the final session of the day, we’d like you to start developing some user personas – typical user portraits – for your Little Wing Pizza app. Who are these users? What motivates them? What are their characteristics?

###Week 02 - Field Trip (Rebase, Dublin); Concept Development; User Research

1 October, 2015

This week we’ll be taking a field trip to Rebase. This is optional, although – thanks to a deal I’ve negotiated with the Rebase team – it is heavily discounted and I would encourage you all to attend. This should be seen as a part of moving yourself towards professionalism.

For self-directed study this week, I’d like you to undertake some informal research with your target audience (on the Monday-Wednesday, non Rebase days). This covers something we need to cover on the module, namely user research.

This week’s deliverables are fluid to reflect the fact that the majority of us are at Rebase. Your deliverables (User Personas and Wireframes) may need to be worked on in Week 03, if you attended Rebase. This is fine, we just need both of these deliverables by Thursday of Week 03.

###Week 03 - Customer Journeys; Wireframing Concepts; Prototyping in InVision

8 October, 2015

In our third week, we’ll consider the importance of onboarding and customer journeys. We’ll explore the different parts of a user journey, and how users make their way through an app or web site. We’ll also  look at how we can use Style Tiles and Element Collages to build out a visual vocabulary that we can pitch to clients.

We’ll take the wireframes for your different concepts and start to pull these together using InVision to build prototypes that we can share with clients and gather feedback on.

Finally, we’ll have a bonus GitHub Refresher session courtesy of Jordan Hamill, a Software Engineer at [ShopKeep](https://www.shopkeep.com/uk). This is a great opportunity, in keeping with our belief in partnerships between academia and industry.

###Week 04 - Prototyping in Keynote

15 October

In our fourth week, we’ll take everything you’ve created to date and we’ll start to build some prototypes using Keynote.

The benefit of this is it gets you thinking about how your app or web site will work as users interact with it. We are \*interaction designers\*, as such it’s important we consider interactions as an inherent part of our design process.

How do your users interact with your design at the macro level? (InVision is perfect for this.) How do you employ animations and other interactions at the micro level? (Keynote is perfect for this.)

My goal is to equip you with a toolset that echoes that used in the ‘real world’ of industry. InVision and Keynote are perfect partners for taking your initial, higher fidelity prototypes and putting them all together in rich, communicative prototypes.

###Week 05 - Informal (In House) Critique

22 October

This will be in-house, i.e. I’ll lead it. I’ll get the students to pitch their ideas to me, so we can make refinements before you come in the following week for a final pitch. *

* This is something we’ll need to discuss, as 17 students pitching for ~10 minutes each will take a bit of time and I’m not sure if you’ll have that kind of time? If not, I’ll need to think of a way of getting them to submit concepts so you can look them over.


----


###Week 06 - The Pitch

29 October

This will be their final submission. We’ll either do a pitch (depending on your availability) or I’ll do a final presentation, perhaps bringing in someone from Eyekiller for the day?

One way or another, I’ll need to wrap up the project that week so I can give the students feedback on what they’ve created.


----


###Week 07 - Weather App Briefing

__Students! What follows, below, are my notes, they’ll give you an idea of how we’re shaping up the second half of the semester’s content. Please don’t embark on any of this project work until we introduce it in Week 07, we are *still* refining it.__

The structure of Weeks 07-12 is up for grabs and we need to consider how we break it all into chunks.

I’d suggest we start by showing the students a styled version of our original HTML prototype. This will give the students a goal, i.e. something they can aim for. I think we need to take our simple app and add a little style to it, which would be \*awesome\*.

We then use this as a point from which to work backwards, introducing JavaScript and the various things you touched on in the HTML prototype.

Kyle, I am in New York this week (for FOWD NYC), so I think you’ll need to kick off the project solo.

I’d suggest showing them:

1. http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Belfast,uk
2. http://jsonprettyprint.com/ /* So they can see the data in the JSON file a little more clearly. */
3. Your nicely designed weather app.

This week is essentially about showing them the trajectory of Weeks 07-12 and giving them a sense that – if they do the work required – they will achieve awesome by the end.

We’ll need to explain what an API is and what a JSON API client is. Something along the lines of an updated version of this [article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/beginners-guide-jquery-based-json-api-clients/) on Smashing Magazine.


----


###Week 08 - Hello JavaScript

I think, before we get down to building the app, we need to introduce them to some fundamentals of JavaScript. (I can do this, if needs be.)

I’d like to introduce them to some fundamental JavaScript principles so that they’re not intimidated by JavaScript, should they encounter it in the wild. (I don’t want them all automatically thinking they should use jQuery for everything.)

I had in mind some simple exercises (probably drawn from Jon Duckett’s [JavaScript and jQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118531647/monographic-21)). Essentially, this would be a JavaScript 101 week.


----


###Week 09 - Getting Jiggy With It 1

This would take some of the concepts you mentioned in your email (below) and explain them:

+ Variables 
+ The DOM
+ Objects
+ Arrays
+ AJAX
+ JSON
+ If statements
+ Strings
+ Functions

I think the above list is too much to cover in one week, so I’d suggest we break it down over two weeks. I also wonder if we should take the AJAX and JSON out of this list and cover it in Week 11. This foucses Weeks 09 and 10 on JavaScript before we start to look at AJAX and JSON.


----


###Week 10 - Getting Jiggy With It 2

This covers the remainder of the list in Week 09, broadening out their JavaScript toolbox.


----


###Week 11 - Hello JSON

With what we’ve covered in Weeks 09 and 10, we introduce JSON. Explaining what a data interchange format is and ensuring that, if they hear the terms ‘JSON’ and ‘APIs’ they know what that means.

This [tutorial](https://mijingo.com/lessons/what-is-json/) at Mijingo is a good overview.


----


###Week 12 - Adding a Little Style

In the final week, we encourage them to take their functional prototypes and style them using CSS. This is where we remind them of what you built and showed them in Week 07, encouraging them to build their own little, nicely styled weather app.

I’d like them, for extra credit, to build a wee promotional site for their web app and consider its branding, but I see this as extra credit work that they’ll do to earn the big marks.
