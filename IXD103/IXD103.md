IXD103 Exploring Identity Overview
==================================

Designing your personal identity… that's the focus. 100%. Last year we did something different, but I'd like to shake things up a little, move the goalposts and set some concrete goals.

My hope is that we secure a nomination (better still, a winner) in the net Awards' Young Designer of the Year, or Young Developer of the Year categories.

We'll look at past winners and audit their work so that we can learn from them. This process – of auditing content – maps onto the real world, where we often find ourselves, as designers, needing to audit a client's content, making suggestions for improvement.

My goal, if you work hard enough, is to ensure you're the next generation of celebrated designers shaping the web. (No pressure.) To do this we'll need to consider your personal brands, ensuring you present yourselves to the world in a carefully considered manner.

We'll look at all aspects of a personal brand: tone of voice, typographic and visual identities, a set of brand guidelines, culminating in a portfolio web site.



Week 01 - Who are you?
----------------------

I don't know you. In our first week I'll rectify that.

We'll explore who you are, developing content you can use online (at Twitter, Instagram and other sites) My key questions:

+ Who are you?
+ Who do you want to be?

We'll use the answers to these questions in a Twitter Bios exercise so that, by the end of Week 01, you've begun to consider your personal brand.

1 + 1 + 1 = 5
-------------


This is all about how you're made up of all of the influences you inherit. How *looking* - **actually looking** - matters, hugely.



Voice and Tone
--------------

The language we use is important… Words. Voice and tone. These define a brand. Are you: Murphy? Mr Murphy? Chris? Christopher? I? He? First person? Third person?

All of this needs work, we'll do a wee analysis of others' work, etc.. Maybe this is a tone 




Brand Strategy
--------------

What exactly do we mean by this?How everything ties together… This might come **before** 'Who are you?' If so, show the Young Designer of the Year folks in this week.









Black and White - 1 (Monogram)
------------------------------

For the next three weeks we're focused on form, pure and simple. Colour comes later.

Some examples.

Wolfgang Weingart, etc. Early Swiss designers, etc..



Black and White - 2 (Wordmark)
------------------------------

Yves Saint Laurent
The Scottish Gallery



Black and White - 3 (Marque)
----------------------------

This is more about marques, visual manifestations of an identity.





A Consistent Brand Across the Web
---------------------------------

GitHub Icon, Twitter Avatar…





Corporate Identity
------------------

Talk about a framework for everything… This could be a before and after style thing? With CI first, followed by a practical session on web-based guidelines.

+ Brand
  + Colour
  + Black and White
  + Reversal
  + Etc.
