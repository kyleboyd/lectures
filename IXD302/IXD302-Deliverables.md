IXD302/DES310: Deliverables
===========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. There are two deliverables:

+ Deliverable 1 - Narrative Web Site (60%)
+ Deliverable 2 - Prototypes (40%)

The expectation is that the prototypes you create for Deliverable 2, will inform your final design for Deliverable 1.

Students are provided with an existing piece of content, which I have carefully developed to include a broad range of content types. Without the burden of having to generate content, they are encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. The content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation.

Deliverable 1 - Narrative Web Site (60%)
----------------------------------------

Using your prototypes as a starting point, this is your opportunity to consider how everything fits together as a piece of narrative design.

We are looking for creative solutions. Consider this an opportunity to showcase your skills and create a substantial portfolio piece that you can use to secure a placement.



Deliverable 2 - Prototypes (40%)
--------------------------------

We are expecting a number of prototypes, as detailed below. For each deliverable I’ve supplied links to content that you might find useful to enable you to deliver what is expected. These links will be added after we have covered them in the lectures.


###2A: HTML Prototype (⅕)

With a focus on HTML as an accessible, semantic layer – a layer that is designed (even without CSS) – demonstrate your understanding of HTML with a particular focus on HTML5’s added semantics, in particular sectioning elements.

Taking the content supplied, build an HTML prototype that demonstrates your understanding of HTML as a design element. Things to consider:

+ Sectioning Elements
+ Tabular Data
+ A11y

+ [HTML5 for Web Designers](http://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers)


###2B: Macro-Interactions (⅕)

Demonstrate an understanding of the effective organisation of content at the page level. Beginning with a Style Tile or an Element Collage, consider the visual grammar of your page, establishing a look and feel you consider appropriate.

Using your Style Tile or Element Collage as a starting point, create wireframes and high-level abstracted HTML prototypes to showcase your understanding of macro-level interactions and how these can enhance the narrative experience.

Taking the content supplied, consider how users are moving between the main sections of the site. Things to consider:

+ Style Tiles
+ Element Collages
+ High-Level HTML, CSS and JS Prototypes

###2C: Micro-Interactions,  (⅕)

Showcase your understanding of interaction at the micro-level, considering user feedback through interactive prototypes. This might include the use of animations on :hover states and other aspects, in short anything that contributes user feedback at a micro-level.

Consider your readers’ interactions. Have you added navigation? If so, how is this handled to provide user feedback.

###2D: Mapping Prototypes (⅕)

Using the mapping content provided as a starting point, demonstrate your ability to create interactive maps that enhance the user experience.This might include an exploration of, amongst others, Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap, Leaflet JS, and Stamen.

###2E: Charting Prototypes (⅕)

Using the tabular content provided as a starting point demonstrate your ability to create data visualisations that amplify the data provided, enhancing the user experience.
