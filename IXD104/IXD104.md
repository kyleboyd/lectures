IXD104/DES107: Imaging and Data Visualisation
=============================================

We’ve been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce students to photographic, illustrative and diagrammatic approaches to communication. Showcasing the power of the image in communication the module equips students with the ability to not only create images, but also brief others’ on how to create images, through the creation of functional mood boards.

The module explores both paper- and screen-based approaches to image creation and introduces students to the differences between vector and raster images, in addition to various file formats and their appropriate uses.

By asking students to deliver their coursework using digital channels, for example grouping courseworks into Flickr pools, students are also introduced to digital distribution methods and exposed to the various channels they might consider to develop and build their web-based profiles.

###Week 01: Introduction; Brief; A picture is worth…

__29 January, 2016__


This week we introduced the module, outlining the journey we'll be taking over the course of the semester. We'll be exploring the use of the imagery in design, focusing on the following: photography, illustration and data visualisation.

Your task for the first week is to set up a Tumblr to gather your research and discovery. We're not worried about the theme, it's the content that matters. An off-the-shelf theme will do.

Please use a theme that has 'infinite scroll' so that we can scroll through your week by week research without constantly having to click 'Next' to take us through to subsequent pages. Thank you!

###Week 02: Through the lens…

__5 February, 2016__

This week we explored the role photography can play in telling stories and how we can use it to create narratives. We explored a number of photographer's work, with a specific focus on architectural photography (to prime you for the brief).

We introduced the brief - 'Macro-Micro' - which explores photography by using the Belfast Campus as subject matter. Your task for the first four weeks is to create a series of six images (three macro, three micro) that explore the campus from a macro (far away) perspective and a micro (close up) perspective.

Please document your research using your Tumblr, hashtagging content for the module with your module code (#IXD104 or #DES107).

###Week 03: Art Direction

__12 February, 2016__

This week we explored the role art direction can play in photography. We also explored the various sources you can acquire photography from, underlining the role the designer plays in the process, shaping the look and feel of a project.

We explored how designers can source photography via a number of avenues, including: client-supplied photography; art directed photography; stock photography; and Creative Commons licensed photography.

We finished by looking at mood boards , exploring how these can be used to shape the direction of a project's photography. This week's task, in addition to working on the 'Macro-Micro' project was to create a mood board (analogue or digital) to explore possible directions for the six images you'll be presenting on Flickr.

On that note the deadline for this first - photographic - part of the project is as follows:

12.00 (Noon), Thursday 18 February

Please email a link to your Flickr pool of six selected images as follows:

Subject Line: Macro-Micro Flickr Pool
Email: chris.murphy@ulster.ac.uk

We will then have a critique next week, giving you formative feedback on your work.

###Week 04: Group Critique

__19 February, 2016__

A group critique encouraging peer learning, this session affords an opportunity to gather feedback on the work done to date. Expect honest opinions, expressed fairly.

###Week 05: Hand to Mouse

__26 February, 2016__

This week we introduced the second of our three topics for the semester: illustration.

We explored the work of a number of illustrators, looking at a range of illustration styles and exploring tools we might use to create illustrations. We also highlighted the work of some of our graduates who have gone on to establish successful careers as world-renowned illustrators.

###Week 06: Getting Iconic

__4 March, 2016__

This week we explored icon design considering the need to create icon sets as a part of the design process.

We looked at the history of icon design, from early history to more recent examples, including Otl Aicher's icons for the 1972 Munich Olympics and Susan Kare's icons for the original Macintosh. We then explored some more contemporary icon designers.

We also introduced the idea of a Master-Apprentice model of learning, learning by copying the work of others.

The reference file for the first Master-Apprentice exercise is available [here](https://github.com/fehler/lectures/blob/master/IXD104/make-this.png). Please recreate this, learning some Illustrator or Sketch skills in the process.

Your other task is to create a series of five icons in a holistic style for each of the following:

+ About
+ Portfolio
+ Blog
+ Location
+ Contact

As before, please document your research using your Tumblr, hashtagging content for the module with your module code (#IXD104 or #DES107).

###Week 07 - A brief is a launchpad…

__11 March, 2016__

This week we explored the idea that a brief is a starting point and - with a little creativity - you can take almost any approach to satisfying it.

We looked at design for the music industry, exploring how different designers and illustrators interpret the same music differently, exploring the work of Peter Saville, Angela Lorenz and Paul Farrington.

We also introduced another Master-Apprentice task, encouraging you to continue learning Illustrator or Sketch.

The reference file for the second Master-Apprentice exercise is available [here](https://github.com/fehler/lectures/blob/master/IXD104/now-make-this.png). Please recreate this, learning some Illustrator or Sketch skills in the process.

Your other task is to create a series of three 12" record covers for each of the following:

+ [Steve Reich – ‘Drumming’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJk4yPwJDk)
+ [Philip Glass – ‘Music With Changing Parts’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slaixLikE2o)
+ [Terry Riley – ‘A Rainbow In Curved Air’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PNbEfLIEDs)

###Week 08: No Lecture

__18 March, 2016__

The university is closed for St. Patrick's Day so this week there is no lecture. That doesn't mean you should stop working, however. Please finalise your illustration pieces during this week so that, when we return after Easter, you're ready to start designing with data.

###Week 09: The Wonderful World of Maps

__20 November, 2015__

Returning to the content supplied (which includes a map) we ask: Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs? We’ll explore the Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap, encouraging the students to delve a little deeper and extend their skillset.

###Week 10: Amplifying Data

__27 November, 2015__

When designing with data, we have an opportunity to amplify that data through the careful use of design. In this lecture we explore charting libraries to present complex statistics elegantly and effectively. We’ll explore Chart.js and Google Charts, encouraging the students to add a new skill to their existing toolbox.

###Week 11: Optimising for Performance

__4 December, 2015__

We’re designing for everyone, regardless of their bandwidth. Let’s stop lazily designing for fat broadband pipes and start thinking of those with less capable connections. Those on mobile, those travelling on limited bandwidth, those less fortunate than us in the developed world. Let’s optimise, relentlessly.
