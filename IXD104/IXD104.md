IXD104/DES107: Imaging and Data Visualisation
=============================================

We’ve been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce students to photographic, illustrative and diagrammatic approaches to communication. Showcasing the power of the image in communication the module equips students with the ability to not only create images, but also brief others’ on how to create images, through the creation of functional mood boards.

The module explores both paper- and screen-based approaches to image creation and introduces students to the differences between vector and raster images, in addition to various file formats and their appropriate uses.

By asking students to deliver their coursework using digital channels, for example grouping courseworks into Flickr pools, students are also introduced to digital distribution methods and exposed to the various channels they might consider to develop and build their web-based profiles.

###Week 01: Introduction; Brief; A picture is worth…

__29 January, 2016__


This week we introduced the module, outlining the journey we'll be taking over the course of the semester. We'll be exploring the use of the imagery in design, focusing on the following: photography, illustration and data visualisation.

Your task for the first week is to set up a Tumblr to gather your research and discovery. We're not worried about the theme, it's the content that matters. An off-the-shelf theme will do.

Please use a theme that has 'infinite scroll' so that we can scroll through your week by week research without constantly having to click 'Next' to take us through to subsequent pages. Thank you!

###Week 02: Through the lens…

__5 February, 2016__

This week we explored the role photography can play in telling stories and how we can use it to create narratives. We explored a number of photographer's work, with a specific focus on architectural photography (to prime you for the brief).

We introduced the brief - 'Macro-Micro' - which explores photography by using the Belfast Campus as subject matter. Your task for the first four weeks is to create a series of six images (three macro, three micro) that explore the campus from a macro (far away) perspective and a micro (close up) perspective.

Please document your research using your Tumblr, hashtagging content for the module with your module code (#IXD104 or #DES107).

###Week 03: Art Direction

__12 February, 2016__

This week we explored the role art direction can play in photography. We'll also explore the various sources you can acquire photography from, underlining the role the designer plays in the process, shaping the look and feel of a project.

###Week 04: What Is Narrative? Learning From Print

__16 October, 2015__

Print’s not dead, far from it. It’s linear (and non-linear) and there’s a lot we can learn from it. In this lecture we explore the legacy of printed narratives, exploring books, magazines and other printed ephemera, where a story forms a backbone of the experience.

+ What is this thing called paper?
+ Getting inspiration off-screen.
+ Show and Tell:
  + i-D
  + The Face
  + Ray Gun and Beach Culture
  + Speak

###Week 05: What Is Narrative? Learning From Music and Film

__23 October, 2015__

From Gorecki to Glass, Kurosawa to Kubrick, there’s a great deal we can learn from the worlds of music and film. In this lecture we introduce the idea of structure, rhythm and cadence, and the importance of considering the spaces – and pauses – within content journeys.

+ Learning from Film
  + Kurosawa
  + Kubrik
  + Haneke
+ How We Structure Song
  + The Shape of Song
  + Verse Chorus Verse
  + The spaces between the notes matter.
+ Pacing
  + The Power of the Pause
  + East (Slow) and West (Fast)
  + Transitions (Fade, Cut)

###Week 07: Visual Vocabulary: Flat → Skeuomorphic → Flat…

__6 November, 2015__

Let’s explore how our visual vocabularly has evolved. Once it was flat, then it became skeuomorphic (allowing the language of the real world to inform our understanding of new, emerging devices), now it’s flat again. We’ll explore the past and current landscape, including Google’s Material Design and IBM’s new IBM Design Language.

###Week 08: Moving From A → B: Designing Transitions

__13 November, 2015__

How we move from A → B matters. Animation can play an important part in the story (and we can learn, equally, from film).

Do we use a dissolve? A Magic Move? A wipe? In this lecture we’ll investigate transitions between states and explore Keynote as a rapid prototyping tool for designing interactions.

We'll also explore the all important micro-transitions that occur when we interact with objects on screen. How might we design buttons that communicate their intent more clearly? We'll collect a series of design patterns for micro-interactions to assist you with the next deliverable.

+ Transitions
  + Fade
  + Dissolve
  + Jump Cut
  + Etc.
+ How do the transitions we choose shape understanding and shape the form?
+ Timing

###Week 09: The Wonderful World of Maps

__20 November, 2015__

Returning to the content supplied (which includes a map) we ask: Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs? We’ll explore the Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap, encouraging the students to delve a little deeper and extend their skillset.

###Week 10: Amplifying Data

__27 November, 2015__

When designing with data, we have an opportunity to amplify that data through the careful use of design. In this lecture we explore charting libraries to present complex statistics elegantly and effectively. We’ll explore Chart.js and Google Charts, encouraging the students to add a new skill to their existing toolbox.

###Week 11: Optimising for Performance

__4 December, 2015__

We’re designing for everyone, regardless of their bandwidth. Let’s stop lazily designing for fat broadband pipes and start thinking of those with less capable connections. Those on mobile, those travelling on limited bandwidth, those less fortunate than us in the developed world. Let’s optimise, relentlessly.

+ A different kind of speed.
+ Blazing Fast
+ Concatenation
+ Minification
+ Compression
